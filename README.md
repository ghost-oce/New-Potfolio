## General Information
This project is to test the developer's understanding on advanced HTML and CSS. The goal is to create a portfolio completely from scratch and integrate their learnings and understanding into a practical HTML.

## Process

The process and steps for this task was looking back at recordings & activity tasks. The very first step taken was creating a wireframe to have something visually there and somewhat a guide.

This very portfolio is not the first draft as there have been other drafts that I wasn't satisified with at all. 

There was many codes being inserted and deleted just to get simple results such as positioning of the HTML etc. 

## Thoughts afterwards 

- Understanding that I'm lacking the knowledge and skills (external circumstances aka job at the office EOTY)

- Sometimes working on another part of a code is more beneficial, better to fix one part than be stuck on one broken part.

- Having comments and creating structure helps a lot, this is from trial and error.
